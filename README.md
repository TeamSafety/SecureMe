# Project background/Business need
Personal safety is a fundamental human right that should be universally upheld. Regrettably, over half of the global population, including women from various backgrounds and age groups, grapple with daily threats to their personal security. These threats can manifest in various scenarios such as walking alone, using transportation services, or merely being in public spaces. Every woman should at least have one personalized safety app on their smartphone.  
Gender-based violence is a pervasive and deeply concerning issue worldwide. This includes various forms of violence and harassment against women, such as physical assault, sexual harassment, domestic violence, stalking, and online harassment. The business need for SecureShe arises from the urgent necessity to combat and reduce these incidents.
Women deserve to feel safe and empowered in their daily lives. SecureShe's business need lies in empowering women to proactively take control of their safety, feel confident in their surroundings, and have access to resources that can help them in emergencies.
After conducting market research, we have identified a need for improvement in women's safety apps, particularly in the area of user privacy. As a result, we are planning to prioritize user privacy by implementing features such as control over data sharing, end-to-end encryption for communications, and the option to disable location sharing when needed.
