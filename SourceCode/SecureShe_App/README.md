# SecureMe

SecureMe is a mobile application designed to provide a swift and convenient way for individuals, particularly women, to access immediate assistance in times of danger or when seeking support. While the app primarily targets women due to research indicating their higher susceptibility to gender-based violence incidents, it also extends its features to accommodate other users for inclusivity.
